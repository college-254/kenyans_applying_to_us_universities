## Deploying the Site

<sub><sup>[:arrow_up: Back to top](#contents)</sup></sub>

This branch is configured to run on the Google Cloud Platform at https://applicants-254-v2.appspot.com. Unlike Heroku's free tier that necessitates the site to go to sleep for at least 6 hours per day, GCP's free tier allows us to serve the site all day.

From the root folder of this repository:

1. Run `$ gcloud config set project applicants-254-v2`. `$ gcloud config list` shows you the current configuration.

1. Run `$ gcloud app deploy`.

## To-do List

<sub><sup>[:arrow_up: Back to top](#contents)</sup></sub>

If you have some time on your hands, help us achieve any of the following. We're welcome to pull requests and suggestions on how to imporove this project.

* Support basic user accounts. 
  * Current students in the US should be able to sign up as mentors/collaborators. 
  * Applicants should be able to sign up as applicants. 
  * Match them up, but let the users find other means of chatting, e.g. WhatsApp. Don't write a messaging platform!

* WordPress used to provide stats for us. We now need to fetch the logs ourselves and get some stats from them.

* There is a version on Heroku and one on gcloud. Figure out a way of ensuring 100% up-time without spending any $$$.
