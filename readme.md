## To-do List

If you have some time on your hands, help us achieve any of the following. We're welcome to pull requests and suggestions on how to imporove this project.

* :white_check_mark: Transfer the college guide from WordPress to markdown documents.

* :white_check_mark: Write a module for converting markdown documents to the HTML needed for the website. As soon as a writer transforms their markdown doc using `markdown_to_HTML.js`, we want it up on the website without having to fiddle with HTML docs.

  * :white_check_mark: Ensure that the content is placed inside main_div

  * :white_check_mark: Display an article's metadata on the web page.

* :white_check_mark: Include a calendar on the home page. Add events related to college applications.

* Style the website to be presentable even on mobile.

* Generate shop data from the database. Implement logic for maintaining shop's inventory.

* ~~Support basic user accounts. Current students in the US should be able to sign up as mentors/collaborators. Applicants should be able to sign up as applicants. Match them up, but let the users find other means of chatting, e.g. WhatsApp. Don't write a messaging platform!~~

    ```

1. From the root folder, run `$ node markdown_to_HTML.js blog-posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` to create a complete HTML document. If you change the markdown document from step 1, re-run step 2 to ensure that the generated HTML documents are up to date.
