Dear Prospective Applicant,

Applying to US universities can be daunting if you don’t know which steps to
take. We successfully obtained scholarships to awesome US universities, and
numerous high school graduates have reached out to us asking how we did it.
Instead of repeating the same information over and over (and to a limited
audience), we decided to avail it here for everyone.

We have borrowed heavily from PDFs that guided us in the application process,
especially [Nathaniel Choge’s New
Horizons](/pdfs/choge-warria-new-horizons-college-guide.pdf) and [Equity Group
Foundation’s College Guide](/pdfs/egf-guide-undergrad-programs.pdf). In sections
where we had nothing to add, we’ve indicated where you can find the original
advice. Otherwise, we’ve updated any outdated information and added the lessons
we learnt along the way.

Our guide will only cover college applications to US universities since that’s
where we applied. We don’t have extensive knowledge about other destinations.
[Study Abroad: Equity Group
Foundation](/pdfs/egf-guide-undergrad-programs-non-us.pdf) provides a starting
point for Sweden, Canada, France, Germany, India, China, Australia, and Russia.

We have tried to be as concise as possible while providing you with actionable
advice. It’s a long journey, but be assured that the results are worth it!
Bookmark this website and consult it as many times as you wish. Aim to have a
reliable internet connection since you’ll spend most of your time online.

Yours Sincerely,

* Chege Gitau (Princeton ‘19)
* Emmanuel Omari (Stanford ‘19)
* Ian Mwaura (Cornell ‘19)
* Norah Borus (Stanford ‘19)
* Resian Kimojino (Princeton ‘19)
