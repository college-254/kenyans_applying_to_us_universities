This [Reddit
post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2ul7xd/what_is_your_best_pro_tip_for_new_college_students/)
discusses some tips for incoming freshmen. I’ll highlight some of the
pro-tips right here and add some of my own:

* Wear your lanyard throughout the first two weeks. You will look back
  to that moment and smile.

* Go to class. Repeat after me: go to class. If you’re not a morning
  person, avoid registering for 8:30am classes.

* Study for the midterms! They’ll come sooner than you think.

* Twitter is especially helpful for keeping up with Kenyan news.

* Seek help. Colleges have a sharing/counselling platform. Reach out.
  Your mental health is really important.

* For some reason, Americans are obsessed with Snapchat. Don’t delete
  WhatsApp; that’s how you’ll keep in touch with your Kenyan friends.
  Facebook is all over the place.

* Don’t sign up for unnecessary listservs. You don’t want to be
  receiving 147 emails per hour. But if it’s a free-food listserv,
  SUBSCRIBE. Text your buddies when there’s a free giveaway; they’ll
  return the favor.

* Library jobs are the best. However, they get filled up super-fast.
  Apply early.

* When shopping, don’t mentally convert the dollars into Kenyan
  shillings. Yes, a 500ml Fanta costs $1.50.

* There’s a readily available daily dose of ice-cream, chicken burgers
  and pizza. Go to the gym once a week.

* Sleep more than you study, study more than you party, and party as
  much as you can. In short, manage your time. And no, sleep is not for
  the weak!

* Use Google Calendar. It is super clutch in keeping track of
  appointments and events.

* Buy/ Rent textbooks from Amazon Prime. College bookstores are
  expensive. Don’t torrent PDFs! Torrenting will get you into trouble.

* Maintain your diligent work ethic. Don’t be that guy who peaked in
  high school.

* Going to your professor’s office hours is not a sign of weakness.

* Read the course syllabus. Note down when you have exams, lest you be
  surprised one morning.

* Go to most of the frosh-themed events since most people will be trying
  to know each other. It’s an easy way to make acquaintances/ friends.
  Joining a campus group is another way to make friends.

* Only date people above 18 and are in college (no high school kids!).
  In the same vein, avoid dating the person next door or in your class
  of 20 people.

* Do your papers, problem sets and take-homes before they are due. It
  will save you from stressful last-minute panic.

* Apparently, Americans have free refills, i.e. you buy a drink once,
  and you can refill your cup for free/ a marginal cost. Exploit this
  opportunity whenever possible.

* Avoid debt. Although you need a credit card to raise your credit score
  (will come in handy when you're trying to buy a house/car), use the
  credit card only for purchases that you can pay off at the end of the
  month. The interest rates are quite steep!

* In between classes, rest at the library. Going back to your dorm for a
  quick nap makes it less likely for you to attend your next class.

* Go to parties; don’t host them. There are clean-ups, stolen stuff,
  broken things and too much drama. Also, be a good guest when invited.

* Reach out of your group, especially if +2 Kenyans are admitted. It’s
  nice to have someone you can speak to in Kiswahili, but don’t cling to
  each other such that you have no time for other people.

* Skim the assigned readings before class.
