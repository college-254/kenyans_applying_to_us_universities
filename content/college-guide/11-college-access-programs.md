College access programs are non-profit organizations that guide students
in their college applications, e.g., test preparation, essay guidance,
college choices, etc. These programs are free to students; their funds
come from donations and grants.

*These programs do not provide scholarships.* Instead, they help
students craft stellar applications to top universities. These
universities are the ones that grant scholarships.

These programs especially target high-performing low-income applicants.
This is largely a matter of who needs more help in completing a college
application. That said, Education USA offers guidance to all applicants,
whether they are in a college access program or not.

Some of the programs require that students to submit applications, and
pass interviews. Once KCSE results are announced, check the programs'
websites as their applications tend to open up at that time and close
after a couple of weeks.

Unless otherwise specified, the programs only accept applications from
students who completed the most recent KCSE.

## [EaSEP (Education and Social Empowerment Program)](http://www.easep.org/)

The students stay at a camp in Nandi Hills for weeks at a time. The
program also pays for its students' [standardized tests]({{< ref

Class Size: 10 students

Requirements:

* A- or better on the KCSE

## EALP (Equity African Leaders Program)

Note that not everyone in the paid internship program joins the College
Counselling Program. As far as US universities are concerned, the
College Counselling Program is the place to be.
