The dates on this page are for applicants looking to join university in fall (September) 2022. They've not been updated to take COVID-19 into account.

Usually, the application process begins after completing high school. This may
not always be the case though. Completing the application while you're still in
school saves you one year. The KCSE is not a requirement for your applications
abroad, but you still need it for Kenyan universities.

The main challenges to completing US college applications while still in high
school are lack of time (school schedules tend to be packed with KCSE prep) and
lack of access to the internet (you'll need to research your options).

The following are steps and the general timelines in the application process. We’ll address these steps in more detail later on.

## Taking the National Exams (KCSE) (November 2020)

As mentioned above, these are not a requirement to your general application, but many people embark on their applications abroad after taking their high school national exams. This makes it a good starting point.

## Preparation for the SAT Exams / Taking the SATs  (December 2020 – November 2021)

Since SAT exams are not the standard test in the Kenyan system, you need ample time to prepare for these exams. It is wisest to start early so that you can familiarize yourself with the SATs and get better at it with time. See [07. Tests That You Need to Take]({{< ref "/college-guide/07-tests-that-you-need-to-take.md">}}) and [08. Test Preparation Resources]({{< ref "/college-guide/08-test-preparation-resources.md" >}}) for more info.

## School Search (May 2021 – October 2021)

Many applicants find themselves having "dream schools", which is not a bad thing,
but you need to widen your net to a few backup schools. As much as you may
really want to go to a certain school simply because you have heard about it,
it’s not always guaranteed that it is your best match. It is important to embark
on an intensive school search process. See [09. Examples of US universities that Kenyans have attended on scholarships]({{< ref "college-guide/09-examples-of-us-universities-that-kenyans-have-attended-on-scholarships.md">}})
and [10. When Considering a University, What Should You Look For?]({{< ref "/college-guide/10-when-considering-a-university-what-should-you-look-for.md" >}}).

There is more to the US than Harvard. Don't be fooled by the term "backup
schools". Backup schools that still offer financial aid to international students
accept around 10% of applicants, so still competitive.

## Completing the College Applications (August 2021 - December 2021)

You'll also need a couple of things from your high school. See [12. High School Transcript, School Report and Letters of Recommendation | Kenyans Applying to US Universities]({{< ref "/college-guide/12-high-school-transcript-school-report-and-letters-of-recommendation.md" >}}).

Don't underestimate the time needed for this. Your teachers will be busy
preparing the seniors for the KCSE. Start early.

Most schools accept the Common Application. This is the platform where you fill
in your application details, respond to school-specific essay prompts, and submit
your applications. See [14. Common Application Essays and Writing Supplements]({{< ref "/college-guide/14-common-application-essays-and-writing-supplements.md" >}})

Used to be that accounts get wiped every year, but that's no longer so. Feel
free to create an account, and get a feel of the application requirements. The
essay prompts may change from year to year, but everything else is mostly
constant. [Thanks Ahmed for pointing this out!]

## Submitting College Applications (November 2021 & December/January 2021-22)

There are two deadlines for college applications. The first one is in October/
November for your top choice, while the other one is in December/January for
additional schools. See [13. Early Action (EA)/ Single Choice Early Action (SCEA)/ Early Decision (ED) & Regular Decision (RD)]({{< ref "/college-guide/13-ea-scea-ed-and-rd.md" >}}).

Some schools schedule an interview between you and an alumni after receiving
your application.

## Applying for Financial Aid (November 2021 & January/February 2022)

Applying for financial aid (e.g. a scholarship) is separate from your college
application. For early applications, the deadline is in November, while for
regular applications, the deadline is in January/February. Schools may have
their separate application process for financial aid. See
[15. Financial Aid Applications]({{< ref "/college-guide/15-financial-aid-applications.md" >}})

## Admission Notification (December 2021 & March/April 2022)

The moment you've been waiting for! If you applied early, you'll get the
school's decision in December. Otherwise, you'll get in March/April. Godspeed!
See [16. Receiving Admissions Decisions](16-receiving-admissions-decisions.md)

## Get Your Kenyan Passport Ready (January 2022 – May 2022)

Passport processing time may vary. If you don't have a passport, get one ASAP.
Don't wait till you hear back from the universities. Spare yourself the trouble
of anxiously camping outside the passport application office for days on end.

## Get Your Student Visa Stamp (May 2022 – July 2022)

After committing to attend a university, they'll send you a form that you'll
present to the US Embassy in Kenya to get a student visa. Visa interview slots
may run out so book yours early. See [17. The I-20 Form, SEVIS Fee and Visa Interview](/college-guide/17-the-i20-form-sevis-fee-and-visa-interview.md)

Additionally, getting your visa early allows you to book the flight ahead of
time. Airlines offer cheaper tickets for flights booked ahead of time. See
[18. Coming to the US - Travel Arrangements > Booking Flights]({{< ref "/college-guide/18-coming-to-the-us-travel-arrangements.md#booking-flights" >}}).

## Travel Checklist (April 2022 - August 2022)

There are a couple things to take care of: vaccinations, booking a flight,
shopping, etc. See [18. Coming to the US - Travel Arrangements]({{< ref "/college-guide/18-coming-to-the-us-travel-arrangements.md" >}})

## Departure (September 2022)

It’s now time to leave for your new home. Esure you have a plan once you arrive
at the airport. You can have someone else pick you up if your school doesn’t
send someone to do it.

*This timeline guide may be flexible in some cases and exceptions may be offered by some schools or in special circumstances.*
