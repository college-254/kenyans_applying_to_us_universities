Your college application will be assessed on [various non-academic
factors]({{< ref
"/college-guide/03-what-are-us-universities-looking-for-in-applicants"
>}}), e.g., character/personal qualities, personal essay,
extracurricular activities, volunteer work, work experience, etc. It is
crucial to learn how to provide relevant information succinctly.

## The STAR Method

S.T.A.R. is a useful acronym for effectively describing particular
behaviors or skills. {{% cite star %}}

### Situation (20%)

Explain the situation so that the reader understands the context of the
upcoming example.

> *When I was a junior in high school, there were several students in my
> math class who were struggling with some of the more difficult
> concepts.*

{{% cite star %}}

### Task (10%)

Talk about what the task that you took responsibility for.

> *With an upcoming national exam, I was asked by my math teacher to
> start a study group to assist the other students.*

### Actions (60%)

Describe the actions that **you** personally took to complete the task.
Avoid "we" statements as they make it difficult for the reader to
understand your behavior or skills. Provide specific and clear examples
of your actions.

> *I set up three study group sessions a week to review class material
> and assignments. I created a comprehensive study guide. I demonstrated
> the best methods for solving difficult problems, explained strategies
> that worked for me, and developed new problems to help them practice.*

A common pitfall is being general instead of being evidence-based, e.g.,
*I like football because of the camaraderie. I feel really close to the
people on the team since we've been through so much together. I hope to
play in college.* {{% cite egfUSGuide %}}

### Result (10%)

Explain the positive outcomes generated from your actions. Highlight
quantifiable results. You may also want to emphasize your key takeaways.

> *Our class average for the national exam was the highest it had been
> in over ten years, and overall the students I helped were able to
> develop a better understanding and appreciation for math.*

## Exercise

For each of your extracurricular activities, make a STAR account.

These accounts will help you answer questions on your application, e.g.,
*Briefly describe any of your extracurricular activities, employment
experience, travel, or family responsibilities that have shaped who you
are. (max 200 words).*

The STAR accounts will also come in handy when [approaching your
referees for letters of recommendation]({{< ref

>}}). {{% cite egfUSGuide %}}
