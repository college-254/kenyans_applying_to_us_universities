This section describes materials that are submitted by your high school
teachers through the Common Application website.

The <dfn id="school-counselor-dfn">school counselor</dfn> is the teacher
who submits documents like the [transcript](#high-school-transcript) and
the [school report](#school-report). In most schools, this role is
filled by the Dean of Studies, or the Careers & Guidance Counselor.

This part requires input from both you and your teachers. Start this
process early, e.g., in June/July. In August, your teachers may be away
on holiday. After September, they may be busy preparing for or
supervising national exams. In November/December, they may be away on
holiday.

## High School Transcript

The [school counselor](#school-counselor-dfn) uploads your transcript.

The transcript contains all of your term grades since form 1, and your
GPA on the 4.0 scale, e.g., [sample

Please note that the transcript should be prepared on a school
letterhead, bear the official school stamp and signed by an authority
(usually the School Principal, but check your high school's policy).

## School Report

The [school counselor](#school-counselor-dfn) uploads the school report.
The report answers questions like:

* How many students graduated with you?
* How many of your classmates end up attending university?
* Does the school offer advanced classes? How many can a student take?
* What was your rank (e.g., top 5%) in the graduating class?
* Does the school report GPA? What was your GPA? What was the highest
  GPA in the graduating class?
* In comparison to your graduating class, how demanding was your
  coursework?
* In comparison to your graduating class, how impressive are your
  extracurriculars?
* In comparison to your graduating class, how do they rate your personal
  qualities and character?
* Have you already taken the leaving exams (e.g., KCSE)? If so, attach
  an official copy of the results.

Note that the school report contains information that is relative to
your classmates in high school. This helps US universities understand
what you achieved in the context of your environment.

## Teacher Recommendations

Teacher recommendations give the college an unfiltered view about you
from a third party. They reveal aspects about you that your test scores
and application essays may not convey. For this reason, they should be
taken really seriously. A majority of colleges will require two to three
letters of recommendation from different people, mostly teachers and
counselors. A few tips on getting good recommendation letters:

* Start early. Look for recommenders way in advance and give them a
  deadline. This deadline should preferably a month(ish) before
  recommendations are due on Common App. This gives your recommender
  time to organize their thoughts and opinions about you and come up
  with an optimal recommendation letter. It also ensures you avoid the
  last minute rush and gives you a boost of confidence.

* Get recommenders' emails (preferably Gmail) and invite them to Common
  App early enough. You might have to show some teachers how to navigate
  Common App, especially if they are doing it for the first time.

* Choose a teacher who has known you closely during your last two years
  of high school. Such teachers can write better letters of
  recommendation for you since they still remember you. Most schools
  prefer that you have one Science/Math teacher and a
  Humanities/Languages teacher.

* Teachers who you worked with outside class are solid recommenders.
  Colleges want to know your character outside of school work. Are you
  passionate about anything? How are your social skills? These are
  things such recommenders could shed some light on.

* Make an appointment with potential recommenders and discuss what you'd
  like highlighted in your recommendation letter. Remind them of things
  that really interested you in class, your accomplishments,  talk to
  them about your extracurricular interests, mention a few challenges
  you encountered and how you overcame them, discuss your future plans
  etc. This will enable the recommender to come up with specific
  examples to use in your recommendation letter and get their
  recommendation juices flowing. This [Teacher Recommendations
  Kit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxcN6nrpsXL6TW9fRzdzM0c4bWs/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-rdCjvh_YiIpz9LGwjFUoUQ)
  PDF should get you started on this process.

* Most importantly, look for someone who'd be enthusiastic about
  recommending you. Make sure to politely ask for a recommendation.

* Finally, waive your right to view recommendation letters on Common
  App. Admissions officers will definitely trust letters of
  recommendations more if they know you haven't seen them. Throughout
  the process, keep reminding them about the deadline and find out if
  they have made progress or ran into any roadblocks setting up
  recommender accounts on the Common App. Make sure to thank them after
  the whole thing is done and inform them about your college decisions.

* The [Teacher Recommendations
  Kit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxcN6nrpsXL6TW9fRzdzM0c4bWs/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-rdCjvh_YiIpz9LGwjFUoUQ)
  has 3 sample letters of recommendation. Show these samples to your
  teachers because unlike typical letters of recommendation, letters
  written for US college applications need to be more detailed and
  personalized.

## Uploading of Documents (Advice for your Recommenders)

While this advice is targeted at your teachers, offer assistance where
necessary, e.g., printing and scanning the documents, creating their
Common App account, etc.

* Open a Common App Recommender Account, preferably using a Gmail
  account.

* Fill in information about the student and your relation to him/her. If
  you're a School Counselor, you'll also complete a school profile and a
  more comprehensive report on the student.

* Type the letter of recommendation. Print the letter on paper bearing
  the school's letterhead, stamp and sign the letter.

* Scan the letters/transcript & send it to your email.

  * Aim for readable Black & White PDF scans since the Common App won't
    accept large files (in 2014, the limit was 500KB for every upload).

  * Each document should be scanned as an independent PDF, i.e. don't
    combine the transcript with the KCSE result slip. If the letter has
    two pages, it should be scanned into a single PDF.

* Download the PDF(s), open your Common App account and then upload the
  scanned documents.

* Your students will then receive a confirmation message on their Common
  App once you've submitted your recommendation. We've advised the
  student to waive their ability to see the letter, so your
  recommendation letter will be confidential.
