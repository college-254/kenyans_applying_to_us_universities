This section describes materials that are submitted by your high school
teachers through the Common Application website.

The <dfn id="school-counselor-dfn">school counselor</dfn> is the teacher
who submits documents like the [transcript](#high-school-transcript) and
the [school report](#school-report). In most schools, this role is
filled by the Dean of Studies, or the Careers & Guidance Counselor.

## High School Transcript

The [school counselor](#school-counselor-dfn) uploads your transcript.

The transcript contains all of your term grades since form 1, and your
GPA on the 4.0 scale, e.g., [sample

Please note that the transcript should:

* Be prepared on a school letterhead
* Bear the official school stamp
* Signed by an authority, e.g., the Principal, or the Dean, etc.

## School Report

The [school counselor](#school-counselor-dfn) uploads the school report.
The report answers questions like:

* How many students graduated with you?
* How many of your classmates end up attending university?
* Does the school offer advanced classes? How many can a student take?
* What was your rank (e.g., top 5%) in the graduating class?
* Does the school report GPA? What was your GPA? What was the highest
  GPA in the graduating class?
* In comparison to your graduating class, how demanding was your
  coursework?
* In comparison to your graduating class, how impressive are your
  extracurriculars?
* In comparison to your graduating class, how do they rate your personal
  qualities and character?
* Have you already taken the leaving exams (e.g., KCSE)? If so, attach
  an official copy of the results.

## Teacher Recommendations

Teacher recommendations give the college an unfiltered view about you
from a third party. They reveal aspects about you that your test scores
and application essays may not convey. For this reason, they should be
taken really seriously. A majority of colleges will require two to three
letters of recommendation from different people, mostly teachers and
counselors. A few tips on getting good recommendation letters:

* Start early, e.g., in June/July. In August, your teachers may be away
  on holiday. After September, they may be busy with national exams.
  Come November/December, they may be away on holiday.

* Get recommenders' emails (preferably Gmail) and invite them to Common
  App early enough. You might have to show some teachers how to navigate
  Common App, especially if they are doing it for the first time.

* Choose a teacher who has known you closely during your last two years
  of high school. Such teachers can write better letters of
  recommendation for you since they still remember you. Most schools
  prefer that you have one Science/Math teacher and a
  Humanities/Languages teacher.

* Teachers who you worked with outside class are solid recommenders.
  Colleges want to know your character outside of school work. Are you
  passionate about anything? How are your social skills? These are
  things such recommenders could shed some light on.

* Make an appointment with potential recommenders and discuss what you'd
  like highlighted in your recommendation letter. Remind them of things
  that interested you in class. Talk about your accomplishments.
  Highlight your extracurricular interests. Reflect on challenges you
  encountered and how you overcame them. Discuss your future plans. This
  will enable the recommender to refer to specific examples.

* The [Teacher Recommendations
  Kit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxcN6nrpsXL6TW9fRzdzM0c4bWs/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-rdCjvh_YiIpz9LGwjFUoUQ)
  has 3 sample letters of recommendation. Show these samples to your
  teachers. Letters written for US college applications need to be very
  detailed and personalized.

* Waive your right to view the recommendation letters. Allow your
  teachers to upload their recommendation letters confidentially.

* Throughout the process, keep reminding them about the deadline. Find
  out if they have run into any roadblocks. Eagerly offer your
  assistance, e.g.,
  * Running errands like printing and scanning documents
  * Troubleshooting their Common App account
  * Answering their questions about the application process

* Don't forget to thank them after the submissions. When college
  decisions are announced, let them know how it went. They are proud of
  you :-)

## Uploading of Documents (Advice for your Recommenders)

* Open a Common App Recommender Account, preferably using a Gmail
  account.

* Fill in information about the student and your relation to them. If
  you're a school counselor, please complete the school profile as well.

* Type the letter of recommendation. Print the letter on paper bearing
  the school's letterhead, stamp and sign the letter.

* Scan the letters/transcript & send it to your email.

  * Aim for readable Black & White PDF scans. The Common App will not
    allow you to upload large files.

  * Each document should be scanned as an independent PDF. For example,
    do not combine the transcript with the KCSE result slip. If a
    document has two pages, both pages should be in the same PDF.

* Upload the scanned PDF(s) in your Common App account. Submit your
  recommendation. Confirm with the student that they also see that you
  submitted the recommendation from *their* Common App. We advise
  students to waive the ability to view the actual letter.
