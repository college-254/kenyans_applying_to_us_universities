## Motivation

Completing the college applications will require a lot of
self-reflection. For example, Harvard asked these questions to its
applicants for the class of 2027:

* Harvard has long recognized the importance of enrolling a diverse
  student body. How will the life experiences that shape who you are
  today enable you to contribute to Harvard? (max 200 words)
* Briefly describe an intellectual experience that was important to you.
  (max 200 words)
* Briefly describe any of your extracurricular activities, employment
  experience, travel, or family responsibilities that have shaped who
  you are. (max 200 words)
* How do you hope to use your Harvard education in the future? (max 200
  words)
* Top 3 things your roommates might like to know about you. (max 200
  words)

This section has been extracted from the [EGF
Guide](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BxcN6nrpsXL6VUlPWThlaTdtZ1E?resourcekey=0-zab22OZ9EjcJWeng8nFplA&usp=sharing).

Take several hours to think about yourself as an individual. Keep notes!
Think comprehensively and write down several examples for each section.

### Background

Where did you grow up? Is it a rural area or an urban one?

How many siblings do you have? Are you the oldest, the youngest, or in
the middle?

How do your parents/guardians earn a living? Are they small-scale
farmers, have a shop, white collar workers?

Who were the important people and role models in your life when you were
growing up?

Are there significant challenges in your life that you've overcome? A
disability? Passing away of a parent/guardian? Growing up poor? Hailing
from a village that is very isolated or with very few people who are
educated?

### Schooling

Where did you go to school (at primary and secondary level)?

If you were allocated a place at national or provincial school were you
able to take it up?

Which subjects have particularly stimulated you and have you performed
particularly well in?

Which examples can you give of pursuing your interest in these fields,
*e.g., researched project on XYZ for National Physics Competition.*

Have you mentored, tutored other students during your studies? For how
long? What did this involve?

### Extracurricular Activities and Responsibilities

How have you spent your time alongside your studies? *E.g., keeping
chickens to pay for my studies;  athletics (long distance runner),
including competing at regional level; peer counseling, offering
guidance to 40 fellow students in my year on issues such as
homesickness, bullying, depression;  Presidents Award, leading camping
treks, eventually being selected as National Assessor.*

Which positions of responsibility have you taken on? *E.g. Laboratory
Prefect, supporting the Chemistry teacher by preparing and clearing away
all experiments.*

Beyond your school, where else have you been active. In your place of
worship? In your community? With local organizations? With your own
business?

What work have you been doing in your workplace? What are your
achievements there? What have you learnt, about the tasks, and about
yourself?

### Next Steps

What subject would you like to study at university? What interests you
about this? If you are weighing up a few subjects, which are they? What
do you see as the similarities and differences between them?

What profession/job do you think you would like to go into after
graduation? What do you know about this field? How have you found out
more? Which skills that you have do you think will be key?

How do you think that studying in the US will help you reach this
ambition, more than studying in Kenya? Are there courses that are not
offered in Kenya?

Note: If you want to work as a doctor in Kenya – as medicine is studied
as a postgraduate in the USA, and is very very competitive – you should
think very carefully before opting to study in the USA.
