The COVID-19 pandemic made it nearly impossible to take the standardized
tests. As a result, some schools have (temporarily) waived standardized
testing requirements. To get the latest information, look up the
school's admissions website.

For example, searching the web for "princeton undergraduate admissions
requirements" leads me to
[https://admission.princeton.edu/how-apply/application-checklist](https://admission.princeton.edu/how-apply/application-checklist),
which says that Princeton University will not require submission of
standardized testing (SAT or ACT) for students who wish to join the
school in September 2022.

## SAT

* Created by College Board, the SAT is a college entrance exam used by
  most US colleges to make admissions decisions. This is not to mean
  that only the SAT matters in your application. There’s a lot more than
  the SAT that is considered for admission to US colleges e.g.
  co-curricular activities, admissions essays, GPA and teacher
  recommendations.

* The SAT is supposedly a test of aptitude. As of March 2016, it
  consists of two sections; evidence-based reading and writing, and
  math. The perfect score is 1600 and the lowest score is 400. It is
  offered throughout the year. Practice, more than intelligence,
  contributes to better performance on the SAT especially because the
  SAT is a very different exam from normal high school exams and
  requires a lot of timing and tact. Practice hard and be smart about
  it!

* The [optional SAT Essay and SAT Subject Tests were
  discontinued](https://blog.collegeboard.org/January-2021-sat-subject-test-and-essay-faq)
  in Jan 2021 for US students, and in June 2021, for international
  students. In their place, schools use alternative signals. For
  example, to evaluate a student's writing skills, schools (e.g.,
  [Princeton](https://admission.princeton.edu/apply/graded-written-paper))
  may ask the student to submit a paper that was graded by their
  teacher.

## College Board

* [College Board](https://www.collegeboard.org/) administers the SAT.
  You need an email account (for convenience, use Gmail) to sign up for
  College Board. Once you sign up for College Board, you get access to a
  few SAT online tests and university profiles. You also send your SAT
  scores to colleges via College Board, meaning a College Board account
  is compulsory for applying to study in the US.

* College Board also offers Advanced Placement tests (APs) which are an
  easy way to get out of most requirements in college. APs are not
  offered at KCSE-oriented high schools, so to place out of requirements
  in your freshman year, you’ll have to take tests administered by your
  university once you get admitted.

* Remember: Do a lot of practice on the SATs! That’s the only way to
  getting stellar scores.

## SAT OR ACT?

* While either of the two can be used for college entrance, some
  students may score better on the SAT than the ACT and vice versa. If
  possible, I’d recommend that you take both. None of the tests seem to
  be statistically more popular than the other, as both get around an
  equal number of takers every year. In the case that you take both of
  them, colleges will focus on the one you score better in, so it
  doesn’t hurt to take chances and spend that extra buck. This guide
  will contain a number of both ACT and SAT sample tests which you can
  attempt before making a choice on which of the two to take.

* That being said, there are differences as pertains to format and
  content between the two that would affect how you score in each of
  them:

* Also, when trying to decide between the ACT and SAT, make up your mind
  early enough! Don’t switch your preference at the last minute since
  you won’t have enough time to prepare.

## Registering for the Exams

* As of August 2016, LTS – East Africa is the only authorized body to
  register students for the SAT and TOEFL – avoid middlemen! The SAT is
  usually offered in the March, May, June, August, October, and
  December.

* Registration deadlines for international students applying through an
  International Representative (LTS is Kenya’s International
  Representative) come sooner, so check College Board and plan to
  register early enough in case there are delays in receiving your
  online test ticket (the paper registration needs to be synced with
  your College Board account so ensure your identifying details are the
  same).

  * [SAT](https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/register/international/fees)
    – $103

  * [TOEFL-iBT](https://www.ets.org/bin/getprogram.cgi?urlSource=toefl&newRegURL=&test=TOEFL&greClosed=new&greClosedCountry=China&browserType=&toeflType=&redirect=&t_country1=group_Kenya)
    – $225

## ProTips

* While you may be thumping your chest after conquering KCSE, we
  strongly discourage taking the December & January SATs. The test
  format and content is different. Give yourself time to prep for the
  SATs.

* You may do the May & June SATs and if necessary retake in August or
  October. December is a bit too late and by then, you should be
  focused on application essays.

## TOEFL-iBT

* Stands for Test of English as a Foreign Language (Internet-Based
  Test).

* Mainly required by Canadian universities. Most American universities
  waive this requirement by virtue of Kenya being an English speaking
  country. Also, English is the language of instruction in Kenyan
  schools.

* In case a school insists that you take the TOEFL, register at LTS –
  East Africa.
