This is not a complete list. If you know of an American university that
has scholarships available for international undergraduate students,
we'll gladly appreciate the tip. Either comment on the Google Sheet, or
use the [feedback form]({{< ref "/feedback.md" >}}). Thanks!

As of 2023, Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Dartmouth, MIT, Amherst, and
Bowdoin are need-blind even to international students. This means that
your ability to pay is not considered when making admissions decisions.

Spread out your schools according to your chances of getting in. Don’t
apply to Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford and MIT as your backup. Be
strategic – have some schools in which you’re likely to get in, and
others where you require the cosmos to realign in your favor.
