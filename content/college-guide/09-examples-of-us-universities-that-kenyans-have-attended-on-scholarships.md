This is not a complete list. If you know of an American university that
has scholarships available for international undergraduate students,
we'll gladly appreciate the tip. Either comment on the Google Sheet, or
use the [feedback form]({{< ref "/feedback.md" >}}). Thanks!

As of 2023, Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Dartmouth, MIT, Amherst, and
Bowdoin are need-blind even to international students. This means that
your ability to pay is not considered when making admissions decisions.

The [MasterCard Foundation Scholars
Program](http://mcfscholarsprogram.berkeley.edu/partner-universities)
has partnered with universities in the US, Canada, Ghana and Costa Rica
to provide undergraduate scholarships to promising students. Click on
the links on MCF Scholars Program’s website to learn about each partner
university’s policy on MasterCard scholarships. Some schools require
special MCF applications, while others award MasterCard scholarships
after general admission. Partner universities in the US are [Arizona
State University](http://global.asu.edu/MCFScholarsProgram), [Duke
University](http://mcfscholars.duke.edu/), [Michigan State
University](http://www.msu.edu/stories/master-card-foundation/), and
[Wellesley College](http://www.wellesley.edu/).

Although UC-Berkeley & Stanford currently have MasterCard scholars,
they’ll not be accepting any more MCF scholars as of August 2016. These
schools have already exhausted their MasterCard grants.

Spread out your schools according to your chances of getting in. Don’t
apply to Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford and MIT as your backup. Be
strategic – have some schools in which you’re likely to get in, and
others where you require the cosmos to realign in your favor.
