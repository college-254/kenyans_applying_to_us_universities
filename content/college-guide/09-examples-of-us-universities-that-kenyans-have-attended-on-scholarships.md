An easy starting point for your college search would be universities
where other Kenyans have attended. Here is a list* to get you started.
The numbers in parentheses indicate the approximate number of undergrad
Kenyan students as of August 2016. If a school doesn’t have a number
next to it, it’s only because we’ve not yet heard from people attending
that school.

(The numbers in parentheses indicate the approximate number of current
undergraduate Kenyan students – freshmen, sophomores, juniors & seniors
– as of August 2016. If a school doesn’t have a number next to it, it’s
only because we’ve not yet heard from people attending that school.)

The [MasterCard Foundation Scholars
Program](http://mcfscholarsprogram.berkeley.edu/partner-universities)
has partnered with universities in the US, Canada, Ghana and Costa Rica
to provide undergraduate scholarships to promising students. Click on
the links on MCF Scholars Program’s website to learn about each partner
university’s policy on MasterCard scholarships. Some schools require
special MCF applications, while others award MasterCard scholarships
after general admission. Partner universities in the US are [Arizona
State University](http://global.asu.edu/MCFScholarsProgram), [Duke
University](http://mcfscholars.duke.edu/), [Michigan State
University](http://www.msu.edu/stories/master-card-foundation/), and
[Wellesley College](http://www.wellesley.edu/).

Although UC-Berkeley & Stanford currently have MasterCard scholars,
they’ll not be accepting any more MCF scholars as of August 2016. These
schools have already exhausted their MasterCard grants.

As of 2016, Princeton, Harvard, Yale, MIT and Amherst are need-blind
even to international students. This means that your ability to pay is
not considered when making admissions decisions.

Spread out your schools according to your chances of getting in. Don’t
apply to Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford and MIT as your backup. Be
strategic – have some schools in which you’re likely to get in, and
others where you require the cosmos to realign in your favor.

* This list has been compiled from [KenSAP](http://kensap.org/) and
  [EaSEP](http://www.easepkenya.org/) since they have the universities on
  their websites. We don’t have data from other organizations &
  independent applicants. It is not an exhaustive list!
