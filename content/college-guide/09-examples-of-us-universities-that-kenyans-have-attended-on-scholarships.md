This is not a complete list. If you know of an American university that
has scholarships available for international undergraduate students,
we'll gladly appreciate the tip. Either comment on the Google Sheet, or
use the [feedback form]({{< ref "/feedback.md" >}}). Thanks!

## Terminology

If a school has 10,000 applicants, and accepts 1,000 of them, then its
**acceptance rate** is (1,000 / 10,000) * 100% = 10%.

A closely related measure is the **yield rate.** Continuing with the
same example above, if 800 of the 1,000 accept the offer of admission
and matriculate into the school, then the yield rate is (800 / 1,000) *
100% = 80%.

{{% /comment %}}

Schools that practice **need-blind admission** do not take into account
an applicant's financial status when deciding whether to accept them. As
of 2023, Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Dartmouth, MIT, Amherst, and Bowdoin
have need-blind admissions policies that apply to international
students as well.

[Some
schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need-blind_admission#Need-blind_for_resident_applicants)
are need-blind for US citizens but not for international students. We've
listed those as **need-aware** because your ability to pay does factor
into whether you're granted admission.

When researching financial aid policies for a given school, ensure that
you look in the international students section as the policies may
differ.

## Building Your List

The conventional approach is to have a mix of reach schools, match
schools, and safety schools. These terms are based on the chance of
admission, with reach schools being the ones with the lowest chances of
admission. For example, a **reach school** is one for which your
academic credentials are in the 25th percentile of the typical incoming
class. {{% cite cbReachMatchSafety %}}

The conventional reach/match/safety framework breaks down when you're an
international student who needs substantial [financial aid]({{< ref
"/college-guide/15-financial-aid-applications" >}}). For example, while
the University of Washington accepted 46% of non-residents in 2023, it
doesn't offer financial aid to international students. {{% cite
uwAdmissions %}} {{% cite uwFinancialAid %}}

The fact that we need universities that offer financial aid to
international students pretty much limits our options to the reach
schools. That said, there are finer levels even within the reach
schools, e.g., you have a higher chance of getting into Amherst than
getting into Harvard.

One typically applies to 8-10 schools. When building your list, try to
stagger the admission rates as much as you can. Your list should not be
Harvard, Stanford, Columbia, Yale, MIT, Brown, Princeton, and Dartmouth.
