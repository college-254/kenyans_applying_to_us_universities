## Calendar

This calendar has events that are relevant to applicants who are applying to US colleges.

<!--
    To generate this, follow the instructions at https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/41207?hl=en
    If you change calendar metadata, e.g. its title, you'll need to 
    get fresh HTML from Google. Otherwise, if all you did was create
    events, there's no need to get fresh HTML from Google. The calendar
    widget will auto-update.
