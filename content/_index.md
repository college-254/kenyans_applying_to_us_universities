This website advises Kenyan students on how to apply to undergraduate
programs (Bachelor's) in the US. We do not cover applying to
postgraduate programs, e.g. Master's and PhD's.

We do not provide scholarships. We only advise students on how to apply
to universities. The universities that we advocate for are wealthy
enough to provide scholarships. Getting admitted is the hardest part.
