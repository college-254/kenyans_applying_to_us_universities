Brief Intro: I’m Chege, currently a 4th year undergraduate student at
Princeton University. I studied at Mang'u High School in Kenya.

This post is directed to Kenyan parents/guardians who have child in high
school that is about to sit for their KCSE. It’s never too early to
start thinking of possible next steps.

If your child has already ~~graduated from high school but has not
started applying to schools in the US~~ started undergraduate classes at
a local university, it’s a bit risky for them to start thinking of
undergraduate US universities. The applications and required exams are
time-consuming.

When I talk about US universities, I’m only referring to the ones that
provide full (or close to full) scholarships to international students
based on how much the family can afford. There are scholarships that
require the student to be an athlete or maintain a certain GPA, but I’m
not well-versed to advise on such scholarships.

## What is it going to cost?

| Item | Cost (USD) | Cost (KES) | Remarks |
| --- | --- | --- | ---|
| [SAT I](https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/register/international/fees) | 89 or 106 | 8,939 to 10,646 | SATs are the equivalent of KCSE. The SAT I tests on Reading, Writing and Math. 89 USD is for Reading and Math only. Some schools don't need the Writing portion. |
| [SAT Subject Tests](https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat-subject-tests/register/international-registration/fees) | 111 or 133 | 11,148 or 13,358 | Subjects include Math, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, etc. 111 USD is for 2 subjects, 133 USD is for 3 subjects. |
| Application Fee | Between 50 and 100 per university. | 5,022 to 10,043 per university | If you these costs are too much, you can request a waiver. Universities usually grant this waiver. |
| Miscellaneous | ~75 | 7,533 | SAT Prep Books, Internet Access |
| Total | Between 275 and 314 | Between 27,619 and 31,536 | We’ve not included the application fees because most applicants request waivers. We recommend applying to 8 schools. |

The costs in this post were obtained on 6th August, 2018. Conversion
rate at the time: 1 USD = 100.43 KES. As with most valuable things in
life, the costs have most likely risen since then.

## Should you and your child take such a bet?

US universities cost ~27m KES for the 4 years. The bet costs ~29,000
KES. There are other costs down the road like air tickets, visa fees and
immunizations, but once your child has a full scholarship at the world’s
best universities, the rest tends to fall into place. For instance,
Princeton paid for my flight.

The universities that provide scholarships tend to accept between 4% and
15% of their 30,000 or so applicants. A good portion of the 30,000
applicants are quite qualified. Luck plays a role in the admission
process, but again, looking at the students who get accepted, it’s
impossible to point out who got lucky. It’s a matter of giving your best
shot and crossing your fingers.

First gauge your child’s current academic ability. Getting an A- or
above in KCSE is a good indicator of performing well in the exams needed
for admission. However, unlike in Kenyan universities where academic
merit is the sole factor, US universities consider a combination of
academic ability, achievements, letters of recommendation and personal
essays.

It’s also crucial that your child also wants to attend a US university.
Introduce them to the idea, but don’t force it on them. The application
process requires a lot of deliberate effort - parental influence can
only take them so far. If your child wants this, but you’re not
enthusiastic about it, give them your support either way. Striving to
obtain a great education is a noble goal.

## Why didn’t I know about this?

Most of us went to Mang’u, Alliance, Starehe, Maryhill, etc. The
teachers at these schools tend to be knowledgeable about the application
process. These schools also tend to have alumni that attended university
abroad, and the alumni usually come back to their alma maters to
encourage the current students to apply to universities abroad.

By spreading this information and guidance to a larger audience, we hope
that more students decide to try their luck at these college
applications.

## What about attending local universities?

If your child is taking Medicine or Law, then a Kenyan university is
probably the better choice. Medicine and Law are not offered as
undergraduate degrees in the US.

The applications open on August 1st, and close by January. The first set
of admission results are out in December 2018, and the second set of
results come are released in March/April 2019. If your child gets
accepted, they’ll start school in the US in September 2019.

A well-crafted college application takes time and effort. Some students
choose to attend the first year of class at Kenyan universities. Others
defer enrollment in order to give college applications their full
attention. I was in the second group - I joined EaSEP at Nandi Hills and
later worked as an SAT Tutor before joining university.

I got accepted into JKUAT's Civil Engineering and was part of the
September 2014 intake. It took a bit of convincing, but my parents
allowed me to defer my JKUAT admission for a year and focus on the
college application process.

Luckily, my bet paid off, but I also have peers who didn't get admitted
or who didn't get a big enough scholarship. However, in the grand scheme
of things, deferring for a year isn't the end of the world.

## Closing Note

Our parents are proud of the decisions that we made three years ago. You
probably will too. If you have the means to take this bet, please do!
